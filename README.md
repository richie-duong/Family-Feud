## Description
This project is a trivia game inspired by the American television game show of the same name, where two teams compete to name the most popular answers to questions that were retrieved from surveys for one of the two teams to be declared winner. The web applications demonstrates my knowledge in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node.js) architecture. All survey questions, answers, team names, and team scores are stored in, retrieved from, and/or updated to MongoDB from the backend files.

As it currently stands, this project is functional, but contains a few exceptions when navigating to the proceeding questions. However, the exceptions are NOT game breaking. The exception occurs since JavaScript is asynchronous and renders pages before the data can be retrieved from MongoDB.

Furthermore, the application is not fully feature complete, as it lacks functionalities that makes the game replayable, customizable, and user-friendly. The section below elaborates on this.

## Improvements in Progress


## Libraries Used
Below is a complete list of libraries used within this project:
